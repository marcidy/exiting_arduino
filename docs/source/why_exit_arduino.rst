Why Exit Arduino?
=================
Arduino is disgned for people who don't have any background in programming to get into hardware.  Take the verify button.  It actually *compiles* the software.  Why not call it "compile"?  

At what age do you understand what "verify" means?  How about "compile"?  

And how much older would you need to be to know that "compile" has a specific meaning in programming?  

Do you know the difference between a compiled language and an interpretted one?  

I think calling the compile button "verify" good, intentional design.  Using familiar terminology is part of making hardware accessible.

They've done a great job making hardware accessible.  I love Arduino, and still use it for projects, and see no reason to disparage the amazing work they've done.

My goal with "Exiting Arduino" is to give people who are curious a jumping off point into what the hardware is actually doing, and how you actually program a microcontroller, and what that programming actually means.  

I want to provide a bridge from Arduino to the more general space of programming firmware that the curious can cross if they wish.  It's a two-way bridge, and frankly, it's ridiculous that people don't consider Arduino "real" hardware.  Of course it's real.  There's nothing fake about it.

So, let's strip away the parts that are Arduino, and the parts which are more general to programming hardware.  You'll quickly see how much effort went into Arduino, and why it's so nice, especially since it's Free.  

This guide can take you away from Arduino if you want, but it also explains what Arduino is doing *under the hood* so to speak, so it's also a way to get familiar with Arduino at a deeper level.

No tool is the perfect tool for every job, but a tool that is great for many jobs is a great tool, and Arduino is exactly that.

Anyways, if you've no place else to start, try :ref:`start_from_ide`.
