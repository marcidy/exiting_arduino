Guide to the Guide
==================

Fundamentally this guide is about programming: creating a list of steps and executing them in sequence.  It's useful to consider the following elements related to all the topics:

    1. How are we gathering information about the task we want to perform
    2. How are we making decisions using that information
    3. How do we transforming those decisions into actions

One entrypoint is the Arduino ecosystem itself, and start peeling back all the layers.

Another is to learn each component required to program a microcontroller.

A third is to jump into using another build system.
