Why Arduino Terminology?
========================
Arduino is meant for people who don't have any background in programming.  Take the verify button.  At what age would you understand what "verify" means?  "compile"?  And when would you know that "compile" has a specific meaning in programming?  Do you know the difference between a compiled language and an interpretted one?  They've dont a great job making hardware accessible.  My goal is to move from Arduino to general hardware programming, so it seems like I pick on their terminology.  They've done an amazing job reterming thing to make them accessible.  I'll poke fun, but I hold what they've done in the highest respect.
