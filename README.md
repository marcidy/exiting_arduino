# Exiting Arduino

This is the repo for [Exiting Arduino](https://exiting-arduino.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on readthedocs.org.

It's written in ReStructured Text for use with Sphinx.

# Goal
Give a jumping off point, starting with Arduino, and leaving with a knowledge about how to commpile C/C++, potentially even using make and cmake.  Basically what someone who has used Arduino wants to know to develop firmware in the wild.

# Contributing
If you have questions on the content, raise a issue on the repo, it probably means the documentation itself needs clarification, and this way I can track it.  If you want credit as a contributor, add yourself below and I'll make sure the changes flow to the docs.  I can probably automate that with a file or something.

If you want to striaght up contribute, please do, either as an issue, or directly with a PR.  If you do a PR, I'll most likely edit it to try to maintain a consistent tone for the whole project, but I'll happily include you as an author.

Please make suggestions in a neutral tone with a focus on content.  Please don't take rejections personally.  If I reject content in a specific place, that's probably a great reason to have a separate section on it, so I can't imagine flatly turning down good content in any case.  At some level too much is too much, but not close to there by any means.

I'd like to build out separate sections for guides to things like an ALU, and the actual logic behind the execution of the instruction cycle.  


Thanks!
